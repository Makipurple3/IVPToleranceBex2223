  First I downloaded the \textbf{knitr package} to create outputs as
  html, pdf or word files when knitting my r markdown file. I also
  loaded the \textbf{pander} package for better presentation
\item
  The \textbf{dplyr} package was installed for better manipulation of
  the data as filtering or creating new variables and \textbf{lubridate}
  for a better manipulation of dates and time
\item
  Then, I installed the \textbf{readxl package} to import my dataset
  which is called \textbf{Box Experiments.xls}
\item
  This dataset contains information related to my master thesis project.
  I used cyber tracker in order to record the behaviors of dyads of
  Vervet monkeys in a box experiment on tolerance from September 2022 to
  September 2023

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I am now using the \textbf{View} function to have a sight on the
  entire dataset and \textbf{glimpse} to display a summary of my dataset
\item
  I have \textbf{20 variables} (here columns) and \textbf{2795 trials}
  (here rows)
\item
  I will now make a brief summary of each variables and their use before
  creating a new dataframe (df) with my variables of interest that I
  will call \textbf{Bex}
\item
  The highlighted variables are the ones I will use for \textbf{Bex}. I
  will then \textbf{clean the data} before heading to the
  \textbf{statistical analysis} and the \textbf{interpretation of the
  results}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{variables-of-boxex}{%
\paragraph{Variables of Boxex}\label{variables-of-boxex}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Date} : ``Date'' is in a \textbf{POSIXct} format which is
  appropriate for the display of time

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I want to use the date to know \textbf{how many sessions} have been
    done with each dyads in my experiment.
  \item
    I will create a variable called \textbf{Session} where \textbf{1
    session = 1 day}
  \item
    The data has values from the \textbf{14th of September 2022} until
    the \textbf{13th of September 2023}
  \item
    I may consider separating the \textbf{12 months} of data in
    \textbf{4 seasons} to make a preliminary check of a potential effect
    of seasonality. Nevertheless since we did not use any tools to
    measure the weather, temperature, humidity or food availability
    (also related to seasonality and weather). Categorizing my data in 4
    without having further data would then be quite arbitrary. If I end
    up doing it in my report, it will be done without any intention to
    include it in my scientific analysis nor my scientific report .
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Time} : ``Time is coded'' in a \textbf{POSIXct} format

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I do not plan to use this variable but we can see that ``Time'' has
    the correct hours displayed with a date which is incorrect.
  \item
    (In the case I wanted to observe \textbf{when the trials occurred
    during the day} as time may have an influence on their behavior
    (\textbf{Isbell \& Young 1993})) I would need to correct the
    incorrect display of the date in the dataset.
  \item
    This variable could also be useful to see when the \textbf{seasonal
    effect} took place as we only went in the morning during summer
    because of the heat while we went later and for longer times in the
    field to do the box experiment in winter
  \item
    For now, the values in ``Time'' are all on the same (wrong) day
    which is the \textbf{31st of December}
  \item
    Note: I first did not intend to keep \textbf{Time} in Bex but I
    needed this variable to see the order of the trails within a day. I
    finally decided to keep it.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Data : chr ``Data'' is coded as \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It describes \textbf{the type of data} being recorded in the
    software \textbf{cybertracker}. We installed the software on tablets
    to record the different behaviors of vervet monkeys in our research
    center
  \item
    In our case, my data was recorded in cybertracker as \textbf{Box
    Experiment} as we created a form specifically for this experiment
  \item
    For this reason we can remove this column since the information it
    contains is unecessary and redundant
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Group : chr The data is coded in r as a \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It describes the \textbf{group of monkey} in which we did the trial
  \item
    I will keep this column to see the amount of trials that we did in
    the 3 group of monkeys which are Baie-Dankie \textbf{(BD)}, Ankhase
    \textbf{(AK)}, and Noha \textbf{(NH)}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  GPSS : num ``GPSS'' is coded as \textbf{numerical}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives the \textbf{south coordinates} in which we started the
    experiment
  \item
    I do not plan to use coordinates nor look at locations so I will
    remove this acolumn
  \end{itemize}
\item
  GPSE : num ``GPSE'' is coded in as \textbf{numerical}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives the \textbf{east coordinates} in which we started the
    experiment
  \item
    I do not plan to use coordinates nor look at locations so I will
    remove this column
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{MaleID} : chr ``MaleID'' is coded as \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It indicates the \textbf{name of the male involved in the trial}
  \item
    I plan to use this to see how factors related to the individual may
    influence the experiment (age, sex, rank)
  \item
    It will also help me see which behaviour was displayed by each
    individuals (here males)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{FemaleID} : chr ``FemaleID'' is coded as \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It indicates the \textbf{name of the female involved in the trial}
  \item
    I plan to use this variable in the same way as ``Male ID''
  \item
    It will also help me see which behaviour was displayed by each
    individuals (here females)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Male placement corn}: dbl ``Male placement corn is coded in r
  as \textbf{double}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    It gives the \textbf{amount of corn given to the male of the dyad
    before the trials}
  \item
    Within a session it happened that we gave more placement corn to
    attract the monkeys again to the boxes. This lead to an update of
    the number in the same session. The number found at the end of the
    session is the total placement corn an individual has received
  \item
    I will fuse this column with \textbf{male corn} as the data has been
    separated between these two variables. This is due to a mistake when
    creating the original box experiment form in cybertracker
  \item
    This variable could be related to the level of motivation of a
    monkey but as it is not directly related to my hypothesis I may not
    use this column. I will re-consider the use of this column later on
  \item
    In regards of this possibility I will change the format of the
    variable to numerical
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{MaleCorn} : dbl ``MaleCorn'' is coded in r as \textbf{double}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives the same information as in \textbf{male placement corn}
  \item
    I will import the values from ``male placement corn'' into this one
  \item
    I will change the format of the variable to numerical
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{FemaleCorn} : dbl The data is coded in r as \textbf{double}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives the \textbf{amount of corn given to the female of the dyad
    before the trials}
  \item
    It works in the same way as ``male placement corn''/``MaleCORN''
  \item
    I will change the format of the variable to numerical
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{DyadDistance} : chr The data is coded in r as
  \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives the \textbf{distance for each trial} that we have done with
    the dyads.
  \item
    The trial number 1 for each dyad was at 5 meters.
  \item
    The maximum was around 10 m while the minimum is 0
  \item
    We will have to remove the ``m'' for meters in order to have a
    numerical variable instead of character
  \item
    Also, since the very first trials per dyad can be considered as a
    kind of learning phase, i may remove the \textbf{15 first trials}
    that were made for each dyad
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{DyadResponse} : chr The data is coded in r as
  \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It indicated which \textbf{behaviour was produced by the dyad's
    during each trial}
  \item
    The different behaviours were: \textbf{Distracted}, \textbf{Female
    aggress male}, \textbf{Male aggress female}, \textbf{Intrusion},
    \textbf{Loosing interest}, \textbf{Not approaching},
    \textbf{Tolerance} and \textbf{Other}
  \item
    I will change the columns associated to each behavior
    (i.e.~Response) of \textbf{DyadResponse} into dichotomic variables
    in order to see the frequency of each behaviour
  \item
    This will allow me to see which behavior occurred more ,and
    behavioural differences could be found between dyads
  \item
    As multiple response could occur within the same trial, multiple
    behaviors can be found in a single cell. I will create a hierarchy
    to reduce the amount of behaviors assigned to each trial (if there
    is more than one). This will also be complemented with the
    information found in the column \textbf{remarks}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      correct any mistakes (ex. if tolerance and aggression are together
      aggression\textgreater tolerance)
    \item
      assign as few labels per trial
    \item
      get a better View and understanding of the data and the most
      common behaviours produced by each dyad
    \item
      create variables that can complement the behaviour found (ex. not
      approaching + looks at partner would be looks at partner + a new
      variable called hesistant to see when the did not come but look at
      the other individual / )
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Projection of the hierarchy (changes will be made)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Create a table with each combination existing
    \item
      Decide what is more important
    \item
      Ex:

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Aggression \textgreater{} Tolerance
      \item
        Tolerance \textgreater{} Not approaching -\textgreater{} Create
        a variable called hesistant in addtion to the tolerance count to
        see frequency of tolerance behaviour that happened after
        \textgreater{} 1min
      \item
        Tolerance \textgreater{} Loosing interest
      \item
        Tolerance \textgreater{} Intrusion
      \item
        Not approaching = looking box but not coming while Loosing
        interest = not paying attention to the box
      \item
        Intrusion \textgreater{} Loosing interest
      \item
        Intrusion \textgreater{} Not approaching
      \item
        Not approaching \textgreater{} Looks at partner
      \item
        We can code every look at partner as no approaching and keep the
        count of looks at partner as additional information
      \item
        Not approaching \textgreater?\textgreater{} Loosing interest ?
        !!
      \item
        Define distracted
      \item
        Not approaching \textgreater{} Distracted
      \item
        Aggression \textgreater{} Not approaching
      \item
        Other \textgreater{} Look case by case and categorize depending
        of behavior
      \item
        Remarks may be used for the same reason
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{OtherResponse} : chr ``The data''OtherResponse'' is coded as
  \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It describes \textbf{any behaviour that is different from the ones
    found in Dyad Response} (meaning â‰  tolerance, aggression, intrusion,
    loosing interest, not approaching, distracted, looks at partner that
    where categorized as \textbf{other})
  \item
    I will have to look at every \textbf{OtherResponse} and rename each
    entry in one of the response already if existing. I will proceed
    case by case.
  \item
    If I want to do an intermediate manipulation I may rename every NA
    in ``OtherResponse'' into \textbf{Response} to see the amount of
    case to treat and how many occurrences seem to not fit in the
    categories of ``DyadResponse''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Audience} : chr ``Audience'' is in r as \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives the \textbf{names of the individuals in the audience}
  \item
    I would like to use it to see the \textbf{amount of audience (big vs
    small)} and the \textbf{dominance level of the audience (high vs
    low)}
  \item
    I will create a variable called \textbf{NAudience} to see hoy many
    individuals are in the audience for each trial
  \item
    After calculating the elo ratings of the individuals using another
    dataset (Life history), I will create a dichotomic variable called
    \textbf{RankAudience} to see effects related to rank with the effect
    of audience
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{IDIndividual1} : chr ``IDIndividual1'' is coded in r as
  \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives the \textbf{names of the individuals that did not approach,
    showed aggression, got distracted or lost interest} during a trial
  \item
    I will have to look at it to see how often these behaviors occurred
  \item
    I will consider how to use this variable during the cleaning of the
    data
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{IntruderID} : chr ``IndtruderID'' is coded as
  \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives the \textbf{name of the individual that intruded the
    experiment during a trial}
  \item
    Intrusion could mean, invade the space of the experiment and
    interact with one of our individual, steal the food, show agnostic
    behavior, stand in very close proximity of the dyad's individuals
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Remarks} : chr The data is coded in r as \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives either additional information concerning the experiment
    when unusual behaviors occurred , mistakes that needed to be
    corrected or details that we wanted to record in case we would need
    them
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Observers :chr The data is coded in r as \textbf{character}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It gives the \textbf{names of the observers during the experiment}
  \item
    We will not use this data as we do not look at the effect that an
    experimenter would have on the monkeys
  \item
    (Should I still look at an effect of the amount of
    experimenter?\ldots maybe better for detailled analysis of our
    study)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  DeviceID :chr ``The data''DeviceID'' is coded in r as

\subsubsection{2.1.1 Merging Male placement corn and
MaleCorn}\label{merging-male-placement-corn-and-malecorn}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I want to process all the missing data in Bex. But before, I will
  merge the column \textbf{MaleCorn} and \textbf{Male placement corn} as
  the data of both columns is supposed to be together under ``MaleCorn''
\item
  Looking manually in the Bex table it seems that very few data is in
  \textbf{MaleCorn} while most of it seems to be in \textbf{Male
  placement corn}
\item
  Every time there is a missing value in Male placement corn we can see
  a value in Male Corn, I will then create a new variable MaleCorn where
  every time that there is NA in male placement corn the value will be
  taken in MaleCornOld (previous malecorn). If there is no NA it will
  take the value of Â´Male placement cornÂ´
\item
  I will first \textbf{rename MaleCorn to MaleCornOld}, then
  \textbf{check the amount of NA's} and then \textbf{merge
  ``MaleCornOld'' and ``male placement corn''} into the \textbf{new
  variable ``MaleCorn''}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
## Number of rows with common NAs in MaleCornOld and 'Male placement corn': 1499 
## Number of occurrences of 0 in MaleCorn: 1499 
## Number of remaining NA values in MaleCorn: 0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I have found \textbf{1499 NA in common} between MaleCornOld and `male
  placement corn', \textbf{1609 NA in Male placement corn} and
  \textbf{2685 in MaleCorn old}
\item
  For the \textbf{merge of MaleCornOld and Male placement corn}, I used
  different conditions: 1.In this code, a new variable MaleCorn is
  created. If there is a missing value in Male placement corn, it takes
  the corresponding value from MaleCornOld; otherwise, it takes the
  value from Male placementcorn. 2.If there are no value in both
  MaleCornOld and Male placement corn (NA,NA) for a given row, I would
  like the code to display 0 as it means that no placement was given
\item
  In this way, I should not loose any data, minimize the mistakes and
  already transform the NA's of this variable into a number which will
  remove the remaining NA's which are meant to be 0
\item
  After the merge I found that there were \textbf{no NA's remaining} in
  the \textbf{``New'' Male Corn} and that \textbf{1499 0's} where found
  in the column which \textbf{corresponds to the amount of common NA's
  found previously} between the \textbf{``Old'' Male Corn} and
  \textbf{male placement corn}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Now in order to see where are located the missing points in the data,
  I'm going to \textbf{print} the variables \textbf{with and without
  NA's}
\item
  The function \textbf{sapply} is used to apply the function
  \textbf{sum} for NA's to each column of the data frame, so each
  variable
\end{itemize}

## Variables with Missing Data:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We can see that out of the 14 variables we have in \textbf{Bex} we
  have \textbf{9 variables with missing data} which are \textbf{Male ID,
  Female ID, DyadDistance, DyadResponse, OtherResponse, Audience,
  IDIndividual1, IntruderID, Remarks}: I will proceed to clean these
  variables one by one

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Since most of the time we did not have any remarks it is
  understandable that this variable contains 2181 NA's out of 2795 rows
\item
  I will first transform every missing data in the column Remark into
  \textbf{No Remarks} and then check that the amount of ``No remarks''
  found
\item
  After the changes we can effectively see that we have \textbf{2181
  ``No Remarks''} and we have no missing data left in that column, I
  will treat this column by hand once all the NA's have been removed
  from the dataset

\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Intruder ID} is a variable that contains the \textbf{name of
  the individuals that made and intrusion during a trial}.
\item
  If more than one individual intruded, his name may be in the comments,
  which I will check when treating the data from this column
\item
  Because nothing was entered when there was no intrusion, I will
  replace every NA's by \textbf{No Intrusion}
\item
  Also, I will use a function to create a new dichotomic variable called
  \textbf{Intrusion}. Every time there is a value in IntruderID, it
  should display 1 (Yes), if not a 0 (No intrusion)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
## Number of 'No Intrusion' in the 'Intruder ID' column after replacement: 2737
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}

  Since the reading of the data is more complicated without the time,
  which was usefull to know which trial was before or after, I changed
  the code made for Bex and added \textbf{Time} in the dataframe. Since
  I will need it for the cleaning of Dyaddistance, I will now extract
  the time from the date. Even if the date is wrong as seen in the first
  output, the time is correct. As in the second output, only the time
  has been kept

prints a message saying that the modification has already been applied,

modifications. This way, running the code multiple times won't cause
redundant changes.

\subsubsection{2.10 Cleaning Female and Male
ID}\label{cleaning-female-and-male-id}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Before cleaning Female and Male ID, here is a list of every dyad of
  the box experiment and their respective groups. This will help us find
  the missing names when only one individual is missing out of the duo
  (either male or female):

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
  \item
    Sirk \& Sey - BD
  \item
    Ouli \& Xin - BD
  \item
    Piep \& Xia - BD
  \item
    Oerw \& Nge - BD
  \item
    Oort \& Kom - BD
  \item
    Ginq \& Sho - AK
  \item
    Ndaw \& Buk - Ak
  \item
    Xian \& Pom - AK
  \item
    Guat \& Pom - Ak
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Note that the 4 letter codes correspond to the femaleID, the 3 letter
  codes to the males ID and the 2 letter codes to the group name of the
  monkeys
\item
  I need to check where are the NA's in both FemaleID and Male ID by
  looking at the rows where data is missing. Since every trial was made
  with a Dyad and never with an single individual, treating these two
  columns together makes more sense. If both individuals are missing I
  may have to delete the row.
\end{itemize}

\item
  \textbf{FemaleID} has \textbf{41 NA's} while they are \textbf{18 NA's}

\item
  In these missing data, we have \textbf{18 NA's} that are in common
  between FemaleID and MaleID which represents the totality of the
  missing values in MaleID
\item
  All the missing data in MaleID are found in consecutive rows, from row
  \textbf{1693} to row \textbf{1710} and are from the group Noha (NH) on
  the 19th of april 2023. We can also see that trials had bee made in
  the same day, and looking at the time of the experiment, the previous
  trials made and the audience we can see that these NA's in female and
  male ID we can asses that the individuals involved were \textbf{Xian}
  for the female ID and \textbf{Pom} for the \textbf{MaleID}. I will
  thus replace these values using a condtion. These NA's in Noha (Trial
  1693 to 1710) are the only NA's that MaleID has and are the only NA's
  of female ID in Noha. I will thus replace every NA of \textbf{MaleID
  NA in Noha} with \textbf{Pom} and every \textbf{Female ID NA in Noha}

  have to replace the NA in female ID

  Before automating the process I will check manually the data to see if
  they are any exceptions or mistakes

modifications}\label{treating-remarks-before-processing-with-new-modifications}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Since I have removed all the missing data from the different columns,
  I now have to correct potential mistakes that can be found and create
  new variables to be able to manipulate better my data.
\item
  Since the column remarks contains corrections and additional
  information, I will treat it now
\item
  Before that lets check how many remarks we have in our dataset, how
  many of the main keywords we can find and make a visual representation
  of it
\end{itemize}

\item
  Before making any changes I will make a count of the total amount of
  remarks and a count and barplot of the main keywords in the column to
  see in which proportion they are found. It has to be noted that some
  of the words are used in different contexts and have different
  meaning. This is why I will clean them manually

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Time : I considered looking at the time sections in which we did the
  expermiment. I will thus look at the time ranges (max and min in the
  day / latest and earliest time) before separating the day in different
  sections to have an idea in which part of the day most of the
  experiments occured. This will not be used in my analysis, but if I
  wanted to, I could interesting to compare the amount of
  experimentations made per day and have a line indicating the time of
  sunrise.
\item
  The \textbf{Minimum Time} in the dataset is \textbf{06:03:26}* while
  the \textbf{Maximum Time} is at \textbf{16:36:59}
\item
  In my box experiment I have this variable called time that tells me
  when the experiment was done. I don't think I need this information
  per se. I was wondering if it could be easy and interesting to see
  from when to when the time occurs and then separate this time in a few
  sections like early, monring, morning, miday, afternoon, end of the
  day
\item
  a.6 to 8 : Early morning b.8 to 10: Morning c.10 to 12: Noon d.12 to
  14: Afternoon e.14 to 17: End of the day
\item
  Last, I want to create a variable called Hour that will take the value
  in Time and round it to the hour in which it is ex: from 06:00 to
  06:59 -\textgreater{} 6, from 07:00 to 07:59 -\textgreater{} 7
  etc\ldots{}
\item
  This will allow me to see when most of the trials occured with more
  detail and I will be to see in which hour most of the trial happened.
  Nevertheless Period will be better for an improved readability

  They are a 10 \textbf{wrong dyads} that I will have to identify in the

  are: -Buk Ginq - 6 occurences -Xin Oort - 4 occurences
\item
  I will change the occurences of \textbf{Buk Ginq} to \textbf{Sho Ginq}
  for \textbf{row 613 to 617} and \textbf{row 931}. I know these trials
  are with Sho Ginq because the comments mentioned Sho in them while
  Male(ID) gave Buk which was a mistake
\item
  For the \textbf{rows from 2710 to 2713} since, Ouli is in the audience
  it is unlikely that we had trials with the dyad \textbf{Xin Ouli}.
  Also I think they are little chances that the names of both
  individuals were entered wrong. I will replace these occurences where
  we had \textbf{Xin Oort} by \textbf{Kom Oort}
\item
  I thus want \textbf{Buk} to be replaced in male ID in rows 613 to 617
  and row 913 with \textbf{Sho} and, \textbf{Xin} to be replaced by
  \textbf{Kom} in rows 2710 to 2713 in Male ID before updating Dyad

  **Experiment Day (across all dyads): This variable should count the
  number of unique experiment days across all dyads. For instance, if
  multiple dyads have trials on the same date, that date should be
  considered a single experiment day.
\item
  \textbf{Dyad Day} (within each dyad): This variable should count the
  number of unique experiment days for each dyad separately. The first
  day of trials for a dyad should be Day 1, the second distinct date of
  trials should be Day 2, and so on.
\item
  DaysSinceStart: Tracks the total number of days since the first
  experiment, counting every calendar day, including gaps between
  experiments.
\item
  ExperimentDay: Counts unique experiment dates, with each distinct date
  assigned a consecutive day number.
\item
  Trial: Numbers the trials sequentially within each dyad, starting from
  1 for each dyad.

  The idea is that for each Dyad, we gave an amount of corn to attract
  the monkey of a dyad to the right distance of his partner for a trial
  by putting corn in experiment box that he could get by approaching. We
  repeated this step as much as needed to have our Dyad at the desired
  distance to continue the trials from the previous day of
  experimentation. This means I will only Keep the last number per dyad
  and day for each day.

  \item
    As multiple behaviours could occur within the same trial, multiple

      get a better view and understanding of the data and the most

  There are 18 cases where was \textbf{Other} as a Response in the
  experiment. Here are the modifications I will make for them:

  -First lets remember that all of these \textbf{DyadResponse} contain
  \textbf{Other} which will make their identification easier

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Row 39: Since there were No Response as ``Other'' I will
    \textbf{Delete Row 39} (Buk Ndaw No Response)
  \item
    Row 286: In \textbf{DyadResponse} instead of \textbf{Other} I will
    put \textbf{Tolerance} and in \textbf{SpecialBehaviour} I will put
    \textbf{Kom;Ap;Sf;Oort,Oort;Rt;Sc} and in \textbf{GotCorn} I will
    put \textbf{No;Oort} (Kom Oort Ooet scream while at the box and Kom
    get the corm of both)
  \item
    Row 300: In \textbf{DyadResponse} I will put \textbf{Tolerance} as
    both individual were at their box at the same time (300 Kom Oort
    Both at boxes; Kom touching the box of Oort)
  \item
    Row 304: In \textbf{DyadResponse} I will put
    \textbf{Oort;Ap;After30} in \textbf{SpecialBehaviour} (Kom Oort Kom
    touching Oort's box. Oort came after 30 sec to her own box.)
  \item
    Row 700: Since ther were No Response as ``Other'' I will
    \textbf{Delete Row 700} ( Nge Oerw No Response)
  \item
    Row 815: Since ther were No Response as ``Other'' I will
    \textbf{Delete Row 815} (Pom Xian No Response)
  \item
    Row 826: Since ther were No Response as ``Other'' I will
    \textbf{Delete Row 826} (Pom Xian No Response)
  \item
    Row 1484: In \textbf{Row 1484} I will replace the
    \textbf{DyadResponse} occurence \textbf{Other by }Tolerance** and
    put \textbf{Sirk;ApproachWithPartner} (Sey Sirk wait for her. moved
    back and waited for sirk to approach and came back)
  \item
    Row 1659: Since there were No Response as ``Other'' I will
    \textbf{Delete Row 1659} (1659 Sho Ginq No Response)
  \item
    Row 1741: In \textbf{Row 1174} Sho stole corn to Ginq. I will put
    \textbf{Sho;Sf;Ginq} in \textbf{SpecialBehaviour} and
    \textbf{No;Ginq} in \textbf{GotCorn} (Sho Ginq Sho took one of her
    corn)
  \item
    Row 2101: The information in \textbf{Row 2101} stating
    \textbf{aggression from Pix} is not clear to whom. I will
    \textbf{delete Row 2101} (Xia Piep aggression)
  \item
    Row 2102: In \textbf{Row 2102} Xia stole corn to Piep. I will put
    \textbf{Tolerance} in \textbf{DyadResponse}, \textbf{Xia;Sf;Piep} in
    \textbf{SpecialBehvaiour} and \textbf{No;Piep} in \textbf{GotCorn}
    (Xia Piep Xia ate corn from both boxes)
  \item
    Row 2103: In \textbf{Row 2103} Xia stole corn to Piep. I will put
    \textbf{Tolerance} in \textbf{DyadResponse}, \textbf{Xia;Sf;Piep} in
    \textbf{SpecialBehvaiour} and \textbf{No;Piep} in \textbf{GotCorn}
    (Xia Piep Xia stolen some pieces from piep box)
  \item
    Row 2104: In \textbf{Row 2104} Xia stole corn to Piep. I will put
    \textbf{Tolerance} in \textbf{DyadResponse}, \textbf{Xia;Sf;Piep} in
    \textbf{SpecialBehvaiour} and \textbf{No;Piep} in \textbf{GotCorn}
    (Xia Piep Xia immediately go for piep box and eat her corn then eat
    his.)
  \item
    Row 2105: In \textbf{Row 2105} Xia stole corn to Piep. I will put
    \textbf{Tolerance} in \textbf{DyadResponse}, \textbf{Xia;Sf;Piep} iN
    \textbf{SpecialBehvaiour} and \textbf{No;Piep} in \textbf{GotCorn}
    (Xia Piep piep got 2 pieces out of 3. Xia took one corn)
  \item
    Row 2170: In \textbf{Row 2170} I will replace \textbf{DyadResponse}
    by \textbf{Female aggress male} (Piep Xia fem ag male)
  \item
    Row 2184: As both individual did not approach and \textbf{Not
    approaching} is already in DyadResponse, I will just remove
    \textbf{Other} from \textbf{DyadResponse}Xia Piep Neither ID
    approach (Xia Piep Neither ID approach)
  \item
    Row 2729: As there was a mistake in \textbf{Row 2729} I will delete
    this line: \textbf{Delete Row 2729} (Xin Ouli opened for oerw)
  \item
    Finally I will delete all the occurences of \textbf{Other} in
    DyadResponse
  \end{itemize}
\item
  First I will remove the lines with the combinations \textbf{Other \&
  No Response}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
## Number of combinations with 'Other' in DyadResponse and 'No Response' in OtherResponse:  5

\begin{verbatim}
## Number of occurrences of 'Other' in DyadResponse left:  13
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Then I will treat the remaining 13 lines according to the rules I
  explained
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
## Number of rows changed:  0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We now have 0 remaing rows with \textbf{Others} in
  \textbf{DyadResponse} and have removed the cases where we had
  different outputs than \textbf{Other Resposne} in the \textbf{Other}
  column

\subparagraph{3.9.3.c Decision making for Dyad Response
Hierarchy}\label{c-decision-making-for-dyad-response-hierarchy}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I will create a \textbf{Hierarchy for DyadResponse} in order to treat
  cases where multiple behaviours were produced within a trial in order
  to reduce the amount of responses and clear any discrepancies that
  could be found
\item
  \textbf{Aggression \& Tolerance}: I will keep \textbf{Agression} as we
  defined tolerance as the absence of any sign of aggression between
  individuals of a Dyad. Each Time we wrote tolerance it means that the
  monkeys touched the boxes at the same time. I will create a variable
  called \textbf{SimulatenousTouch} to record every time the box did the
  action at the same time. Then I will in every case of aggression and
  tolerance within a trial keep Aggression: \textbf{Aggression
  \textgreater{} Tolerance}. (Note that aggression is not yet a variable
  in itself but instead we have Male aggress female \& Female aggress
  male as occurences of aggression)

\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Tolerance \& Intrusion}: I will keep \textbf{Tolerance}.
  Before replacing these occurrences I will created a variable called
  \textbf{Intrusion} the value will be Yes if there was Intrusion in
  DyadResponse (alone or with another response) and No if there wasn't
  any Intrusion: \textbf{Tolerance \textgreater{} Intrusion}

\item
  Now that all the variables have been treated and cleaned I want to
  modify thew variables in Bex to keep only the ones I need and to put
  them in the right order
\item
  First lets print the name of all the variables before reordering them
  and keeping only the variables of interest

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Because I will look at the audience and individual factors on the
  individuals of the dyads i must make a lsit of all the individudals
  for which I will need to extract information.
\item
  First lets extract all of the names of individuals in audience
\item
  Step 1: Clean and Process the Audience Data: We first clean the
  Audience column, ensuring that any ``NA'' values are replaced with
  ``No audience'' and split the combined names. Whitespace around names
  is also removed.
\item
  Step 2: Recalculate AmountAudience: This step ensures the
  AmountAudience variable is correctly updated after splitting the
  Audience column.
\item
  Step 3: Summarize Changes: We count how many times the value ``NA''
  was replaced with ``No audience'' and display this count using cat().
\item
  Step 4: Categorize Audience Members: We categorize audience members
  into ``Male'', ``Female'', and other relevant categories based on the
  length of their IDs. Specific identifiers like ``unkam'', ``unkaf'',
  etc., are given appropriate labels.
\end{itemize}

Step 5: Display Tables by Category: We split the audience count table
into sections for ``Male'', ``Female'', and other categories, and then
display these tables separately. The use of knitr::kable() provides a
professional table format that is more suitable for RMarkdown.

  monotonic relationships. Less sensitive to outliers and does not

\item
  Using a Spearman correlation we found a spearmans correlation
  coefficient (rho) which is equal to 0,4285714 indicating a moderate
  positive association between ranks of age difference and tolerance
  proportion. It seems that as the age difference increases, the
  tolerance proportion increases
\item
  But looking at the p-value of 0,2992 we can see that the correlation
  is not statistically significant and there is a 29,92\% probability
  that the observed correlations occured by chance

\item
  The correlation coefficient (0.0784) is very weak

    Hypothesis about the Presence of High-Ranking Individuals:
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

The presence of a higher number of high-ranking individuals in the
audience will negatively correlate with the level of tolerance achieved
among vervets in the box experiment. This is expected to result in
higher frequencies of aggressive behaviors, intrusions, and loss of
interest, particularly from lower-ranking individuals.

    Hypothesis about Partner Agonistic Behaviors:
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Vervets tolerance levels in the box experiment will be influenced by
their partner's display of agonistic behaviors. Specifically, partners
who exhibit more frequent agonistic behaviors towards their partner will
lead to decrease in their motivation to participate in future trials.

    Hypothesis about the Establishment of an Optimal Distance:
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

During the box experiment, vervet dyads will establish an ``optimal''
distance for interaction, characterized by a higher frequency of
tolerance compared to other distances. This optimal distance is expected
to signify that the individuals tolerate each other more effectively at
this specific proximity .

  \item
    Hypothesis about Age and Rank:
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

The age and rank of individual vervets within the group will influence
the success of the trials in the box experiment. Specifically, older and
higher-ranking individuals are expected to exhibit lower rates of
success compared to dyads consisting of younger and lower-ranked
individuals. This decrease in success is anticipated to be associated
with a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors displayed by older and
higher-ranking individuals towards their partners. (I'm not sure this
hypothesis makes sens, I have the feeling age and rank must have an
influence but I don't know how to put it, I will think about it)

    Hyptohesis about seasonality
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Seasonality is expected to impact the motivation of vervet dyads to
participate in the box experiment. We hypothesize that dyads will have
lower motivation, as indicated by a reduced number of trials, during the
summer months compared to the winter months. This difference in
motivation is likely influenced by temperature and food availability. To
test this hypothesis, we will categorize the data into four seasonal
periods, each spanning four months, and analyze whether there is a
significant effect of seasonality on the motivation to engage in the
trials.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 1}: Influence of High-Ranking Individuals
\end{itemize}

Variables Needed:

\textbf{DyadResponse} (specifically, ``aggression'' responses)
\textbf{Amountaudience} (to measure the number of individuals in the
audience) \textbf{Audience\ldots15} (to identify the names of
individuals in the audience for calculating dominance ranks) \textbf{Elo
rating} of the individuals based on the ab libitum data collected in IVP
(which I have to calculate asap)

Statistical Analysis:\textbf{Logistic Regression}, as it could analyze
the influence of high-ranking individuals on the occurrence of
aggression in dyad responses. This will help determine whether the
presence of high-ranking individuals affects the likelihood of
aggression.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 2}: Impact of Partner's Agonistic Behaviors
\end{itemize}

Variables Needed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{DyadResponse} (specifically, ``aggression'' responses)
\item
  \textbf{MaleagressF} (male's aggression towards female)
\item
  \textbf{FemaleaggressM} (female's aggression towards male)
\end{itemize}

Statistical Analysis: \textbf{Logistic Regression} as it could be used
to assess how the occurrence of aggression in dyad responses is
influenced by the partner's gender-specific agonistic behaviors.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 3}: Identification of an Optimal Interaction
  Distance
\end{itemize}

Variables Needed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{DyadDistance} (distance between boxes)
\item
  \textbf{Tolerance} (as a binary outcome)
\end{itemize}

Statistical Analysis: \textbf{generalized Linear Model (GLM)} to
investigate whether there is an optimal distance that leads to a higher
likelihood of tolerance (Tolerance = 1).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 4}: Role of Age and Rank
\end{itemize}

Variables Needed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Tolerance} (as a binary outcome)
\item
  \textbf{Male and Female} (to identify individuals' ages and ranks)
\item
  \textbf{Dyad} (to link individuals to dyads)
\item
  \textbf{Birthdate} to calculate the age of each individual
\end{itemize}

Statistical Analysis: \textbf{Logistic Regression} Logistic regression
can be employed to determine whether the age and rank of individual
vervets within dyads have an impact on the likelihood of tolerance
(Tolerance = 1).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 5}: Influence of Seasonality
\end{itemize}

Variables Needed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Date} (to categorize data into seasons)
\item
  \textbf{Trial} (to count the number of trials in each season) and the
  data for at least 365 days so i can separate the data in 4 (1 year = 4
  seasons = 12*4 month) to see if they may be an effect of seasonality
  on the motivation (amount of trials) of the dyads
\end{itemize}

Statistical Analysis:

ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis Test: Depending on the distribution of your
trial data, you can use either ANOVA (if the data are normally
distributed) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (for non-normally distributed
data) to assess the impact of seasonality on the number of trials. If
significant differences are found, you can follow up with post-hoc tests
to identify which seasons differ from each other. Please note that the
effectiveness of these analyses may depend on the distribution of your
data and specific research objectives. You may also consider conducting
exploratory data analysis (e.g., visualization) to gain a better
understanding of your dataset before performing these analyses.
Additionally, if you have specific questions about data preprocessing or
variable transformations, feel free to ask for further guidance.
--\textgreater{} I took this from ChatGPT, I have to look more into it

\textbf{REMARKS}: So here are a few updates I made in the document. I
also planned to send my cleaned data to Radu (the statistician of UNINE)
as he was keen to help me find the right test. Of course I will also
look again in Bshary's and Charlotte's work with the boxes and improve
these suggestions that are quite simple for now

Also I still have to clean the last grpahs about male/female aggression
as I didn't finish that yet. I juste wanted to share my hypothesis and
ideas for statistics so I can soon go into the ``serious'' work

Anyway, thank you in advance for your help \textless3

\end{itemize}

In summary, studying dyadic interactions, particularly between males and
females in vervet monkeys, not only enhances our understanding of
evolutionary origins and adaptive advantages of complex cognition but
also provides valuable insights into human social behavior, cooperation,
and cognitive foundations shared across species. These studies bridge
the gap between animal behavior research and cognitive science, offering
interdisciplinary perspectives on the complexities of social
interactions and their implications for both animal and human societies.

  \textbf{Tolerance}: Tolerance: An individual has an encounter with a
  conspecific and can freely leave but remains in the encounter without
  acting aggressively toward the conspecific. (Pisor \& Surbeck, 2019)
\item
  \textbf{Agression}
\item
  \textbf{Session}
\item
  \textbf{Trial}
\item
  \textbf{Group}: In the Primate order, groups are individuals ``which
  remain {[}physically{]} together in or separate from a larger unit''
  and interact with each other more than with other individuals.6 This
  definition does not cover all uses of the word ``group'' in the social
  sciences (e.g., human identity groups who identify with a common name
  or symbol may or may not interact with one another more frequently
  than with other individuals). Because of this ambiguity, we use the
  word ``community'' when referring to humans to better capture the
  notion of spatial proximity, per Ref. 54. Members of the same group
  are referred to as ``same-group'' and those from another group
  ``extra-group.'' (Pisor \& Surbeck, 2019)
