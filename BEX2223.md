## Introduction


## 0.Opening the data
### Loading data

```{r LoadData, include=FALSE}

# Load knitr for  markdown outputs
library(knitr)

##Load pander for better presentation of the outputs
library(pander)

##Load dplyr for better manipulation of the data
library(dplyr)

# Load readxl package to import the data
library("readxl")

# Read xlsx files
Boxex <- read_xls("/Users/maki/Desktop/Master Thesis/BEX 2223 Master Thesis MAung Kyaw/Box Experiments.xls")

``` 

* First I downloaded the **knitr package** to create outputs as html, pdf or word files when knitting my r markdown file.I also loaded nd the **pander** package for better presentation
* The **dplyr** package was installed for better manipulation of the data as filtering or creating new variables
* Then, I installed the **readxl package** to import my dataset which is called **Box Experiments.xls**

## 1.Explore the data

### Description of the initial datset - "Boxex"

```{r View and Glimpse of Boxex, echo=FALSE}

# First view of my datset
View(Boxex)

#GLimpse function to see the summary and  the structure

cat("Glimpse of the the Box Experiment dataset:\n\n")
glimpse(Boxex)
```



* I am now using the **glimpse** function to display a summary of my dataset
* I have **20 columns** (here variables) and **2795 rows**

* I will now make a brief summary of each variables and their use before creating a new dataframe (df) with my variables of interest

* The highlighted variables are the ones I will use for my new df. I will then **clean the data** before heading to the **statistical analysis**

* The variables we have in this dataset are the following:

#### Variables of Boxex

* **Date**               :
    "Date"cis in ac**POSIXct** format which is appropriate for the display of time 

    * I want to use the date to know **how many sessions** have been done with each dyads in my experiment. 
    * I will create a variable called **Session** where **1 session = 1 day**
    * The data has values from the **14th of September 2022** until the **13th of September 2023**
    * I may consider, in parallel of my hypothesis, to separate the data in *4 seasons* to make a preliminary check of a potential effect of seasonality. Nevertheless the fact that we did not use anywithout      tools to measure the weather and the idea to make a categorization in 4 seasons without considering the actua quite arbitrary. I may do it but with no intention to include this in my scientific report.
    l temperature, food quantitiy and other elements related to seasonailty make this categorizationn a categorization where 12 months of          data will be separated in 4 categories
   

    
* **Time**                  : 
     "Time is coded" in a **POSIXct** format 
     
    * I do not plan to use this variable but we can see that "Time" has hours displayed with a date which is incorrect. 
    * In the case I wanted to observe **when the trials occurred during the day** as time may have an influence on their behavior, I would need to correct the incorrect display of the date in the dataset.
    * This variable could also be usefull to seen when  the **seasonal effect** took place as we only went in the morning during summer because of the heat while we went later and for longer times in the          field to do the box experiment in winter 
    * For now, the values in "Time" are all on the same (wrong) day which is the **31st  of December** 
    * I will describe the variable again after cleaning it
    
    
* Data                   : chr 
    "Data" is coded as **character**
    * It describes **what type of data** has been entered the software **cybertracker**. We installed the software on tablets to record the different behaviours of vervet monkeys in our research center
    * In our case, the whole dataset is coded as **Box Experiment** as it was the type of behaviour that we were recording
    * For this reason we can remove this column as the information is unecessary
    
* Group             : chr 
    The data is coded in r as a **character**
    * It describes the **group of monkey** in which we did the trial
    * I will keep this column to see theamount of trials that we did in the 3 group of monkeys which are Baie-Dankie **(BD)**, Ankhase **(AK)**, and Noha **(NH)**
    
* GPSS                   : num 
    "GPSS" is coded as **numerical**
    * It gives the **south coordinates** in which we started the experiment
    * I do not plan to use coordinates nor look at locations so I will remove this acolumn
    
  
* GPSE                   : num 
    "GPSE" is coded in as **numerical**
    * It gives the **east coordinates** in which we started the experiment
    * I do not plan to use coordinates nor look at locations so I will remove this column
  
  
* **MaleID**             : chr 
    "MaleID" is coded as **character**
    * It gives the **name of the male involved in the trial**
    * I plan to use this to see how factors related to the individual may influence the            experiment (age, sex, rank)
    * It will also help me see which behaviour was displayed by each individuals (here males)
  
  
* **FemaleID**           : chr
    "FealeID" is coded as **character**
    * It gives the **name of the female involved in the trial**
    * I plan to use this variable in the same way as "Male ID"
    * It will also help me see which behaviour was displayed by each individuals (here females)
    
  
  
* **Male placement corn**: dbl
    "Male placement corn is coded in r as **double**
    * It gives the **amount of corn given to the monkey of the dyad before the trials**
    * Within a session it happened that we gave more placement corn t to attract the monkeys again to the boxes. This lead to an update of the number in the same session. The number that at the end of the         session is the total placement corn an individual has received
    * I will fuse this column with **male corn***as the data has been separated between these two variables. This is due to a mistake when creating the original box experiment form in cybertracker
    
    * This variable could be related to the level of motivation of a monkey but as it is not directly related to my hypothesis I may not use this column. I will re-consider the use of this column later on
    * I will change the format of the varaible to numerical 
  
  
* **MaleCorn**           : dbl
    "MaleCorn" is coded in r as **double**
    * It gives the same information as in ***male placement corn***
    * I will add the data from "male placement corn" into this one
    * I will change the format of the varaible to numerical 
    
    
* **FemaleCorn**         : dbl
    The data is coded in r as **double**
    * It gives the **amount of corn given to the monkey before the trials**
    * It works in the same way as "male placement corn"/"MaleCORN"
    * I will change the format of the varaible to numerical 
  
  
* **DyadDistance**       : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * I gives the **distance for each trial** we have done with the dyads. 
    * The trial number 1 first  for each dyad was at 5 meters
    * The maximum was around 10 m while the minimum is 0
    * We will have to remove the "m" for meters in order to have a numerical variable insterad of character
    
  
* **DyadResponse**       : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the **response for each trial** we have done with the dyads
  
* **OtherResponse**      : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the **response if it is not one of the options** (so if it is not tolerance, aggression, intrusion, loosing interest, not approaching)
    * I will have to recode all the NA's in other response as response to see how often another answer as the one given before occured
    
* **Audience...15**      : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the ***name of the individuals in the audience***
    * I would like to use it to see the **amount of audience (big vs small)** and the **dominance level of the audience (high vs low)**
    * I will need to put this variable against the dominance levels/rank of the monkeys
    
* **IDIndividual1**      : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the **names of the individuals that did not approach, show aggression or lost interest** during a trial
    * I will have to look at it to see how often these responses that tolerance occured and maybe look which individual of the dyad showed more aggression, lost of interest or did         not approach as a response to a trial
    
* **IntruderID**         : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the **name of the individual that did an intrusion during the experiment**
    *This could be linked to the audience effect to see how often a (low vs high) ranking individual did intrude
    
* **Remarks**            : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives supplementary information concerning the experiment when something unsual happened or if we needed more details, this may be necessary to look into details for better     details in some trials
    
* Observers               .chr
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the **names of the observers during the experiment**
    * We will not use this data as we do not look at the effect that an experimenter would have on the monkeys
    


## 2. Cleaning the data

### Select variables
* Since I do not want to work with this whole dataset, I'm gonna select the variables of interest using "select"

* But before I may want to make a few changes already by merging **Male corn** and **Male placement corn** into " Male corn" and maybe replacing all of the NA's in "Other response" by response

* I will then keep Date, MaleID, FemaleID, Male placement corn, MaleCorn, FemaleCorn, DyadDistance, DyadResponse,OtherResponse, Audience...15, IDIndividual1, IntruderID, Remarks
