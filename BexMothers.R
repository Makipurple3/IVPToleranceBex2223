# Adapt code for date during experiment: The box experiment was conducted for a year with different starting
# dates for the different dyads. I will check if the females from the box experiment had a baby during the period
# they were tested

# If FirstRecorded for the baby which name is in code is during the Bexperiod of the mother, then it wills say Yes
# IF the FirstRecorded of the BB is instead out of the experiment period, then no

# 1)First create BexStart using  these different starting dates for each mother:
# Sirk	14.09.2022, Piep	16.09.2022, Oerw 22.09.2022, Ouli		27.09.2022, Oort		12.12.2022
# Ginq		27.09.2022, Ndaw		29.09.2022
# Xian		10.03.2023

# 2)The create BexEnd setting the end at these date
