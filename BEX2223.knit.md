# Introduction


# 0.Opening the data
### Loading data



* First I downloaded the **knitr package** to create outputs as html, pdf or word files when knitting my r markdown file. I also loaded the **pander** package for better presentation
* The **dplyr** package was installed for better manipulation of the data as filtering or creating new variables and **lubridate** for a better manipulation of dates and time
* Then, I installed the **readxl package** to import my dataset which is called **Box Experiments.xls**
* This dataset contains information related to my master thesis project. I used cyber tracker in order to record the behaviors of dyads of Vervet monkeys in a box experiment on tolerance from September 2022 to September 2023

* I am now using the **View** function to have a sight on the entire dataset and **glimpse** to display a summary of my dataset
* I have **20 variables** (here columns) and **2795 trials** (here rows)

* I will now make a brief summary of each variables and their use before creating a new dataframe (df) with my variables of interest that I will call **Bex**

* The highlighted variables are the ones I will use for **Bex**. I will then **clean the data**  before heading to the **statistical analysis** and the **interpretation of the results**


#### Variables of Boxex

* **Date**               :
    "Date" is in a **POSIXct** format which is appropriate for the display of time 

    * I want to use the date to know **how many sessions** have been done with each dyads in my experiment. 
    * I will create a variable called **Session** where **1 session = 1 day**
    * The data has values from the **14th of September 2022** until the **13th of September 2023**
    * I may consider separating the **12 months** of data in **4 seasons** to make a preliminary check of a potential effect of seasonality. Nevertheless since we did not use any tools to measure the weather,         temperature, humidity or food availability (also related to seasonality and weather). Categorizing my data in 4 without having further data would then be quite arbitrary. If I end up doing it in my          report, it will be done without any intention to include it in my scientific analysis nor my scientific report .
    

    
* **Time**                  : 
     "Time is coded" in a **POSIXct** format 
     
    * I do not plan to use this variable but we can see that "Time" has the correct hours displayed with a date which is incorrect. 
    * (In the case I wanted to observe **when the trials occurred during the day** as time may have an influence on their behavior (**Isbell & Young 1993**)) I would need to correct the incorrect display of the date in the dataset.
    * This variable could also be useful to see when  the **seasonal effect** took place as we only went in the morning during summer because of the heat while we went later and for longer times in the          field to do the box experiment in winter 
    * For now, the values in "Time" are all on the same (wrong) day which is the **31st  of December** 
    * Note: I first did not intend to keep **Time** in Bex but I needed this variable to see the order of the trails within a day. I finally decided to keep it.
    
* Data                   : chr 
    "Data" is coded as **character**
    * It describes **the type of data** being recorded in the software **cybertracker**. We installed the software on tablets to record the different behaviors of vervet monkeys in our research center
    * In our case, my data was recorded in cybertracker as **Box Experiment** as we created a form specifically for this experiment
    * For this reason we can remove this column since the information it contains is unecessary and redundant
      
* Group             : chr 
    The data is coded in r as a **character**
    * It describes the **group of monkey** in which we did the trial
    * I will keep this column to see the amount of trials that we did in the 3 group of monkeys which are Baie-Dankie **(BD)**, Ankhase **(AK)**, and Noha **(NH)**
      
* GPSS                   : num 
    "GPSS" is coded as **numerical**
    * It gives the **south coordinates** in which we started the experiment
    * I do not plan to use coordinates nor look at locations so I will remove this acolumn
    
* GPSE                   : num 
    "GPSE" is coded in as **numerical**
    * It gives the **east coordinates** in which we started the experiment
    * I do not plan to use coordinates nor look at locations so I will remove this column
  
* **MaleID**             : chr 
    "MaleID" is coded as **character**
    * It indicates the **name of the male involved in the trial**
    * I plan to use this to see how factors related to the individual may influence the            experiment (age, sex, rank)
    * It will also help me see which behaviour was displayed by each individuals (here males)
  
  
* **FemaleID**           : chr
    "FemaleID" is coded as **character**
    * It indicates the **name of the female involved in the trial**
    * I plan to use this variable in the same way as "Male ID"
    * It will also help me see which behaviour was displayed by each individuals (here females)
    
* **Male placement corn**: dbl
    "Male placement corn is coded in r as **double**
    * It gives the **amount of corn given to the male of the dyad before the trials**
    * Within a session it happened that we gave more placement corn to attract the monkeys again to the boxes. This lead to an update of the number in the same session. The number found at the end of the         session is the total placement corn an individual has received
    * I will fuse this column with **male corn** as the data has been separated between these two variables. This is due to a mistake when creating the original box experiment form in cybertracker
    
    * This variable could be related to the level of motivation of a monkey but as it is not directly related to my hypothesis I may not use this column. I will re-consider the use of this column later on
    * In regards of this possibility I will change the format of the variable to numerical 
  
* **MaleCorn**           : dbl
    "MaleCorn" is coded in r as **double**
    * It gives the same information as in **male placement corn**
    * I will import the values from "male placement corn" into this one
    * I will change the format of the variable to numerical 
    
    
* **FemaleCorn**         : dbl
    The data is coded in r as **double**
    * It gives the **amount of corn given to the female of the dyad before the trials**
    * It works in the same way as "male placement corn"/"MaleCORN"
    * I will change the format of the variable to numerical 
  
  
* **DyadDistance**       : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the **distance for each trial** that we have done with the dyads. 
    * The trial number 1 for each dyad was at 5 meters. 
    * The maximum was around 10 m while the minimum is 0
    * We will have to remove the "m" for meters in order to have a numerical variable instead of character
    * Also, since the very first trials per dyad can be considered as a kind of learning phase, i may remove the **15 first trials** that were made for each dyad
  
* **DyadResponse**       : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It indicated which **behaviour was produced by the dyad's during each trial**
    * The different behaviours were: **Distracted**, **Female aggress male**, **Male aggress female**, **Intrusion**, **Loosing interest**, **Not approaching**, **Tolerance** and **Other**
    * I will change the columns associated to each behavior (i.e. Response) of  **DyadResponse**    into dichotomic variables in order to see the frequency of each behaviour
    * This will allow me to see which behavior occurred more ,and behavioural differences could be found between dyads 
    * As multiple response could occur within the same trial, multiple behaviors can be found in a single cell. I will create a  hierarchy to reduce the amount of behaviors assigned to each trial (if  there     is more than one). This will also be complemented with the information found in the column **remarks**
      1. correct any mistakes (ex. if tolerance and aggression are together aggression>tolerance)
      2. assign as few labels per trial 
      3. get a better View and understanding of the data and the most common behaviours produced by each dyad
      4. create variables that can complement the behaviour found (ex. not approaching + looks at partner would be looks at partner + a new variable called hesistant to see when the did not come but look at         the other individual / )
      
    * Projection of the hierarchy (changes will be made)
      - Create a table with each combination existing
      
      - Decide what is more important
      - Ex:
        - Aggression > Tolerance
        - Tolerance > Not approaching -> Create a variable called hesistant in         addtion to the tolerance count to see frequency of tolerance                 behaviour that happened after > 1min
        - Tolerance > Loosing interest
        - Tolerance > Intrusion
        - Not approaching = looking box but not coming while Loosing interest           = not paying attention to the box
        - Intrusion > Loosing interest
        - Intrusion > Not approaching
        - Not approaching > Looks at partner
        - We can code every look at partner as no approaching and keep the             count of looks at partner as additional information
        - Not approaching >?> Loosing interest ? !!
        - Define distracted
        - Not approaching > Distracted
        - Aggression > Not approaching
        - Other > Look case by case and categorize depending of behavior
        - Remarks may be used for the same reason
        
  
* **OtherResponse**      : chr 
    "The data"OtherResponse" is coded as **character**
    * It describes **any behaviour that is different from the ones found in Dyad Response**     (meaning ≠ tolerance, aggression, intrusion, loosing interest, not approaching, distracted, looks at partner that where categorized as **other**)
    * I will have to look at every **OtherResponse** and rename each entry in one of the response already if existing. I will proceed case by case.
    * If I want to do an intermediate manipulation I may rename every NA in "OtherResponse" into **Response** to see the amount of case to treat and how many occurrences seem to not fit in the categories of  "DyadResponse"
    
* **Audience**      : chr 
    "Audience" is in r as **character**
    * It gives the **names of the individuals in the audience**
    * I would like to use it to see the **amount of audience (big vs small)** and the **dominance level of the audience (high vs low)** 
    * I will create a variable called **NAudience** to see hoy many individuals are in the audience for each trial
    * After calculating the elo ratings of the individuals using another dataset (Life history), I will create a dichotomic variable called **RankAudience** to see effects related to rank with the effect of audience
    
* **IDIndividual1**      : chr 
    "IDIndividual1" is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the **names of the individuals that did not approach, showed aggression, got distracted or lost interest** during a trial
    * I will have to look at it to see how often these behaviors occurred
    * I will consider how to use this variable during the cleaning of the data
    
* **IntruderID**         : chr 
    "IndtruderID" is coded as **character**
    * It gives the **name of the individual that intruded the experiment during a trial**
    * Intrusion could mean, invade the space of the experiment and interact with one of our individual, steal the food, show agnostic behavior, stand in very close proximity of the dyad's individuals
    
* **Remarks**            : chr 
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives either additional information concerning the experiment when unusual behaviors occurred , mistakes that needed to be corrected or details that we wanted to record in        case we would need them
    
* Observers               :chr
    The data is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the **names of the observers during the experiment**
    * We will not use this data as we do not look at the effect that an experimenter would have on the monkeys
    * (Should I still look at an effect of the amount of experimenter?...maybe better for detailled analysis of our study)
    
* DeviceID             :chr
    "The data "DeviceID" is coded in r as **character**
    * It gives the **name of the device/tablet** used to record the data during the experiment
    * We will not use this data either
    
    

# 2. Treating missing data

## 2.1. Creating a new dataframe - Bex
* Since I do not want to work with the whole dataset, I'm gonna select the variables of interest using the function **select**

* I will keep Time, Date, Group, MaleID, FemaleID, MaleCorn, Male placement corn, FemaleCorn, DyadDistance, DyadResponse, OtherResponse, Audience, IDIndividual1, IntruderID, Remarks

### 2.1.1 Merging Male placement corn and MaleCorn
* I want to process all the missing data in Bex. But before, I will merge the column **MaleCorn** and **Male placement corn** as the data of both columns is supposed to be together under "MaleCorn"
* Looking manually in the Bex table it seems that very few data is in **MaleCorn** while most of it seems to be in **Male placement corn**
* Every time there is a missing value in Male placement corn we can see a value in Male Corn, I will then create a new variable MaleCorn where every time that there is NA in male placement corn the value will be taken in MaleCornOld (previous malecorn). If there is no NA it will take the value of ´Male placement corn´
* I will first **rename MaleCorn to MaleCornOld**, then **check the amount of NA's** and then **merge "MaleCornOld" and "male placement corn"** into the **new variable "MaleCorn"**


```
## Number of rows with common NAs in MaleCornOld and 'Male placement corn': 1499 
## Number of occurrences of 0 in MaleCorn: 1499 
## Number of remaining NA values in MaleCorn: 0
```

* I have found **1499 NA in common** between MaleCornOld and 'male placement corn', **1609 NA in Male placement corn** and **2685 in MaleCorn old**


* For the **merge of MaleCornOld and Male placement corn**, I used different conditions:
1.In this code, a new variable MaleCorn is created. If there is a missing value in Male placement corn, it takes the corresponding value from MaleCornOld; otherwise, it takes the value from Male placementcorn.
2.If there are no value in both MaleCornOld and Male placement corn (NA,NA) for a given row, I would like the code to display 0 as it means that no placement was given
* In this way, I should not loose any data, minimize the mistakes and already transform the NA's of this variable into a number which will remove the remaining NA's which are meant to be 0
* After the merge I found that there were **no NA's remaining** in the **"New" Male Corn** and that **1499 0's** where found in the column which **corresponds to the amount of common NA's found previously** between the **"Old" Male Corn** and **male placement corn**


### 2.1.2 Cleaning FemaleCorn


```
## Number of remaining NA values in FemaleCorn: 0
```

### 2.2 Cleaning variables with missing data

* Now in order to see where are located the missing points in the data, I'm going to **print** the variables **with and without NA's**

* The function **sapply** is used to apply the function **sum** for NA's to each column of the data frame, so each variable


```
## Variables with Missing Data:
```



|              |    x|
|:-------------|----:|
|MaleID        |   19|
|FemaleID      |   60|
|DyadDistance  |   33|
|DyadResponse  |   47|
|OtherResponse | 2758|
|Audience      |  924|
|IDIndividual1 | 2143|
|IntruderID    | 2737|
|Remarks       | 2181|

```
## Variables with No Missing Data:
```



|           |  x|
|:----------|--:|
|Time       |  0|
|Date       |  0|
|Group      |  0|
|FemaleCorn |  0|
|MaleCorn   |  0|

* We can see that out of the 14 variables we have in **Bex** we have **9 variables with missing data** which are **Male ID, Female ID, DyadDistance, DyadResponse, OtherResponse, Audience, IDIndividual1, IntruderID, Remarks**:  I will proceed to clean these variables one by one 

* MaleID	19
* FemaleID	60
* DyadDistance	33
* DyadResponse	47
* OtherResponse	2758
* Audience	924
* ID Individual1 2143
* IntruderID 2737
* Remarks 2181

* Before making treating the NA's in the dataset I will make a backup of the data at this point: 


### 2.3 Treating variables with missing data

#### 2.3.1 Cleaning "Remarks" - (2181 NA's)
* Since most of the time we did not have any remarks it is understandable that this variable contains 2181 NA's out of 2795 rows
* I will first transform every missing data in the column Remark into **No Remarks** and then check that the amount of "No remarks" found 

* After the changes we can effectively see that we have **2181 "No Remarks"** and we have no missing data left in that column, I will treat this column by hand once all the NA's have been removed from the dataset


```
## Number of 'No Remarks' in the 'Remarks' column: 2181
```

```
## 
## No Remarks    Remarks 
##       2181        614
```


### 2.3.2 Cleaning "Intruder ID" - (2737 NA's)
* **Intruder ID** is a variable that contains the **name of the individuals that made and intrusion during a trial**.
* If more than one individual intruded, his name may be in the comments, which I will check when treating the data from this column
* Because nothing was entered when there was no intrusion, I will replace every NA's by **No Intrusion**
* Also, I will use a function to create a new dichotomic variable called **Intrusion**. Every time there is a value in IntruderID, it should display 1 (Yes), if not a 0 (No intrusion)



```
## Number of 'No Intrusion' in the 'Intruder ID' column after replacement: 2737
```
* We previously had 2737 NA's in IntruderID while now we have the same amount of occurrences of IntruderID which shis that the transformation went as intended

#### 2.3.3 Cleaning "IDIndividual1" - (2143 NA's)

* IDIndividual1 is meant to report the name of the individual that did a behavior such as not approach, show aggression or loose interest during a trial
* I will now replace every NA in this column by **No individual** and print the amount of NA's left and the amount of changes made

  
  

```
## Number of NAs replaced in IDIndividual1: 2143 
## Number of remaining NA values in IDIndividual1: 0
```



### 2.6 Cleaning "Audience" - (924 NA'S)
* Audience is made to report every name of individuals around our dyad during a given trial
* I will replace every NA by **No audience** as no entry means the absence of other individuals around
* I will also create a new variable called "Amount audience" that will have to tell me how many individuals are found in the column Audience 


```
## Number of changes made in 'Audience': 924
```

```
## Remaining NA values in 'Audience': 0
```


### 2.7 Cleaning "OtherResponse" - (2758 NA'S)

```
## Number of changes made in 'OtherResponse': 2758
```

```
## Remaining NA values in 'OtherResponse': 0
```


### 2.8 Cleaning of "Time"
* Since the reading of the data is more complicated without the time, which was usefull to know which trial was before or after, I changed the code made for Bex and added **Time** in the dataframe. Since I will need it for the cleaning of Dyaddistance, I will now extract the time from the date. Even if the date is wrong as seen in the first output, the time is correct. As in the second output, only the time has been kept


```
## [1] "1899-12-31 09:47:50 UTC" "1899-12-31 09:50:07 UTC"
## [3] "1899-12-31 09:53:11 UTC" "1899-12-31 09:54:28 UTC"
## [5] "1899-12-31 09:55:19 UTC" "1899-12-31 09:56:56 UTC"
```

```
## [1] "09:47:50" "09:50:07" "09:53:11" "09:54:28" "09:55:19" "09:56:56"
```


### 2.9 Cleaning DyadDistance
* Before looking at the NA's of Dyaddistance I will remove the "m" that is in front of every number to      have a numerical variable
* Then I will look at the location of the NA's in the data to treat them case by case.

* We have 69 missing values in  DyadDistance. I will look at each row in it's context as the actual distance of the box was always dependent of the previous trials. I will start with the bigger number as for now the oldest trial is at the last row while the closest one is in row 1.



  - If **tolerance** was achieved **twice in a row**     =   <1m
  - If **aggression** (male agress female or female agress male), not approaching,or **loosing     interest** occured                                   =   >1m
  - If **distracted** or **intrusion** occured           =    same distance
  
  1. **24** - In trial23 (0m) there was aggression then at trial24 (1m) there was tolerance. The 24th trial is supposed to be at **1m**
  2. **27** - In trial25 (1m) there was not approaching then at trial26 (2m) there was tolerance.The 25th trial is supposed to be at **2m**
  3. **95** - In trial93 (2m ) there was male agress female then at trial 94 (3m) there was not approaching. The 95th trial is supposed to be at **4m**
  4. **492** - In trial490 (0m) there was tolerance then at trial491 (0m) there was tolerance. The 492nd trial is supposed to be at **0m**
  5. **744** - In trial742 (3m) there was aggression then at trial743 (4m) there was tolerance. The 744th trial is supposed to be at **4m**    
  6. **971** - In trial969 (0m) there was tolerance then at trial970 (0m) there was tolerance. The 971st trial is supposed to be at **0m**
  7. **1113** - In trial1111 (2m) there was tolerance then at trial1112 (0m) there was tolerance. The 1113th trial is supposed to be at **0m**
  8. **1130** - In trial1128 there was another dyad so we can not use this cell. Then at trial1129 (3m) there was not approaching. Nevertheless, we don't have any DyadResponse, i will thus **delete this row** 
  9. **1164** - In trial1162 (3m) there was not approaching then at trial1163 (3m) there was not approaching. The 1164th trial is supposed to be at **4m**
  10. **1261** - The two
  preivous trials were made with another Dyad. Also DyadResponse is not available. I will thus **delete this row**
  11. **1341** - In trial1339 (0m) there was tolerance then at trial1340 (0m) there was tolerance. The 1341st trial is supposed to be at **0m**

  60. **2234** - The trial did not happen because they where not at the right distance. I will thus **delete this row**
  61. **2287** - Since there are no DyadResponse I will **delete this row**
  62. **2437** - Since there are no DyadResponse I will **delete this row**
  63. **2569** - In trial2567 (1m) there was tolerance then at trial2568 (1m) there was tolerance. The 2569th trial is supposed to be at (0m)
  64. **2579** - In trial2577 (1m) there was tolerance then at trial2578 (0m) there was not approaching. The 2579th trial is supposed to be at **1m**
  65. **2580** - The two previous trials were made with another Dyad. Also DyadResponse is not available. I will thus **delete this row**
  66. **2643** - Since there are no DyadResponse I will **delete this row**
  67. **2676** - In trial2674 (1m) there was tolerance then at trial2675 (0m) there was tolerance. The 2676th trial is supposed to be at **0m**
  68. **2709** - In trial2707 (2m) there was tolerance then at trial2708 (2m) there was tolerance. The 2709th trial is supposed to be at **1m**
  69. **2729** - In trial2727 (3m) there wastolerance then at trial2728 (2m) there was tolerance. The 2729th trial is supposed to be at **2m**


* Now that I have looked at each missing line and saw which ones to keep, I decided to create a new variable called **Distance**. I will also to create a new variable called **No trial**.
* For the variable **Distance** I will replace each row where there was missing data with a value and I will delete the ones where no values could be assigned. This will allow me to have no missing data and find a number to each trial that has been done

* Before making the changes i'm gonna make a backup called **BackupbeforeDistanceNA**



 

```
## Number of NA's in DyadDistance after replacements and deletions: 1 
## Data size after deletions: 2748
```

```
## Row index with NA in DyadDistance: 1925
```
*It seems that there is still the row 1925 with an NA in DyadDistance

70. **1925** - In trial1923 (2m) there was distracted then at trial1924 (2m) there was tolerance. The 2725th trial is supposed to be at **2m**


```
## Row index with NA in DyadDistance:
```



*In this modification, I added a check to see if the columns Dyadistance and Distance already exist in your dataframe (Bex). If they do, it prints a message saying that the modification has already been applied, and no changes are made. If they don't exist, it proceeds with the modifications. This way, running the code multiple times won't cause redundant changes.
  
* **24 values** were inserted in **Distance** to replace the NA's where the distance could be found by looking at the previous rows. The **46 remaining NA's** were then **removed** from Distance **leaving 0 remaining NA in  the variable "Distance"**


### 2.10 Cleaning Female and Male ID

* Before cleaning Female and Male ID, here is a list of every dyad of the box experiment and their respective groups. This will help us find the missing names when only one individual is missing out of the duo (either male or female):
  a. Sirk & Sey - BD
  b. Ouli & Xin - BD
  c. Piep & Xia - BD
  d. Oerw & Nge - BD
  e. Oort & Kom - BD
  
  f. Ginq & Sho - AK
  g. Ndaw & Buk - Ak
  
  h. Xian & Pom - AK
  i. Guat & Pom - Ak
  
* Note that the 4 letter codes correspond to the femaleID, the 3 letter codes to the males ID and the 2 letter codes to the group name of the monkeys



* I need to check where are the NA's in both FemaleID and Male ID by looking at the rows where data is missing. Since every trial was made with a Dyad and never with an single individual, treating these two columns together makes more sense. If both individuals are missing I may have to delete the row.

```

```
## Row numbers with missing values in FemaleID not in MaleID:  865, 866, 867, 868, 869, 870, 871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, 877, 878, 879, 1808, 1809, 1810, 1811, 1812, 1813, 1814, 1815, 1816, 1817, 1818, 1819, 1820, 1884, 1885, 2619, 2620, 2621, 2622, 2623, 2624, 2625, 2626, 2627, 2628, 2629
```
    
    
* **FemaleID** has **41 NA's** while they are **18 NA's** in **Male ID**
* In these missing data, we have **18 NA's** that are in common between FemaleID and MaleID which represents the totality of the missing values in MaleID

* All the missing data in MaleID are found in consecutive rows, from row **1693** to row **1710** and are from the group Noha (NH) on the 19th of april 2023. We can also see that trials had bee made in the same day, and looking at the time of the experiment, the previous trials made and the audience we can see that these NA's in female and male ID we can asses that the individuals involved were **Xian** for the female ID and **Pom** for the **MaleID**. I will thus replace these values using a condtion. These NA's in Noha (Trial 1693 to 1710) are the only NA's that MaleID has and are the only NA's of female ID in Noha. I will thus replace every NA of **MaleID NA in Noha** with **Pom** and every **Female ID NA in Noha** with **Xian**




```
## Number of remaining NA values in MaleID after replacement:  0
```

```
## Number of remaining NA values in FemaleID after replacement:  41
```

```
## Number of rows with missing values in both MaleID and FemaleID after replacement:  0
```





* In order to clean FemaleID, I will use the data from the now complete MaleID. I will use conditions stating that depending which name is found in MaleID when there is an NA in FemaleID, a certain name will have to replace the NA in female ID


* Before automating the process I will check manually the data to see if they are any exceptions or mistakes

    - Sirk if MaleID is Sey
    - Ouli if MaleID  is Xin
    - Piep if MaleID  is  Xia 
    - Oerw if MaleID  is  Nge

# 3. Correction and creation of New Variables 

### 3.1 Making a backup of Bex
* Before making new changes I will make a backup of my dataset at this point




### 3.2 Treating Remarks before processing with new modifications
* Since I have removed all the missing data from the different columns, I now have to correct potential mistakes that can be found and create new variables to be able to manipulate better my data.
* Since the column remarks contains corrections and additional information, I will treat it now


* Before that lets check how many remarks we have in our dataset, how many of the main keywords we can find and make a visual representation of it

#### 3.2.2 Vizualization of the Remarks Keywords


* Before making any changes I will make a count of the total amount of remarks and a count and barplot of the main keywords in the column to see in which proportion they are found. It has to be noted that some of the words are used in different contexts and have different meaning. This is why I will clean them manually


```
## Number of 'No Remarks' entries:  2139
```

```
## Number of actual remarks entries:  603
```

* There will be 599 entries I will have to treat manually in the Excel Spreadsheet for the Remarks

<img src="BEX2223_files/figure-html/Remarks Exploration-1.png" width="672" />

```
## Total number of keyword occurrences in the Barplot:  822
```


#### 3.2.3 Exporting of Bex
* I will now export the dataset and treat manually treat the remarks in an Excel spreadsheet before uploading it again and creating a new dataframe. I will also print a Glimpse of Bex to have information before the manual changes


```

#### 3.2.4 Journal of manual changes in Bex excel spreadsheet

* Before treating all the data in the Remarks I will create a few columns to redistribute information
  1. **Context**: To add contextual information 
  2. **SpecialBehaviour** : To report any particular behaviour an individual could have done during a trial
  3. **Got corn**, to see if the individual got the corn or not

* Also whenever i will have treated a remark, i will replace it with "Treated". And if I have to delete the row I'll write "Delete". After re importing the data I will make a count of these changes to see if I still have the correct amount of cells and changes that have been done


* 1. Creation of the columns **Context**, **SpecialBehaviour** and **GotCorn**
* 2. Default values for the new columns are
**NoContext**, **NoSpecialBehaviour** & **Yes**

  a.Context: **BoxMalfunction**, **BoxOpenedBefore**, **NoExperiment**, **Agonistic**, **Guat;Ap;Xian**, **CornLeak**, **BetweenGroupEncounter**, **ContactCalling**,

### 3.4 Time - Creation of Period and Hour
* Time : I considered looking at the time sections in which we did the expermiment. I will thus look at the time ranges (max and min in the day / latest and earliest time) before separating the day in different sections to have an idea in which part of the day most of the experiments occured. This will not be used in my analysis, but if I wanted to, I could interesting to compare the amount of experimentations made per day and have a line indicating the time of sunrise. 


* The **Minimum Time** in the dataset is **06:03:26*** while the **Maximum Time** is at **16:36:59**
* In my box experiment I have this variable called time that tells me when the experiment was done. I don't think I need this information per se. I was wondering if it could be easy and interesting to see from when to when the time occurs and then separate this time in a few sections like early, monring, morning, miday, afternoon, end of the day
* a.6 to 8 : Early morning
  b.8 to 10: Morning
  c.10 to 12: Noon
  d.12 to 14: Afternoon
  e.14 to 17: End of the day
  
* Last, I want to create a variable called Hour that will take the value in Time and  round it to the hour in which it is ex: from 06:00 to 06:59 -> 6, from 07:00 to 07:59 -> 7 etc...
* This will allow me to see when most of the trials occured with more detail and I will be to see in which hour most of the trial happened. Nevertheless Period will be better for an improved readability


### 3.5 Date - Creation of Month and Day
*  i want to Create a variable called month to see the month of the experiment and day so I know which day of the experiment it was (1st, 10th, 1000th..)




### 3.6 Male and Female ID - Creation of Dyad, Trial and Session

* I will use Female and Male ID to create different variables
  1. While checking if there are still any mistakes  in **FemaleID and MaleID** using **unique**, I saw that some of the names are in the wrong rows. I want the **3 letter male codes** whether they are in the column FemaleID or MaleID to be in the **new column Male** while I want the **4 letter female codes** whether they are in FemaleID or MaleID to be in the **new column Female** before checking again with unique that the transformation worked. I will use mutate

```

  2. Create the variable called **Dyad** created by combining the name of FemaleID and MaleID into one name with a space between the two codes. For information the 3 letter code is the name of the female while the 4 letter code is the name of the male like displayed here with the correct dyads;
  
  * The correct dyads are:
    - Buk Ndaw	
    - Kom Oort	
    - Nge Oerw	
    - Pom Guat	
    - Pom Xian	
    - Sey Sirk	
    - Sho Ginq	
    - Xia Piep	
    - Xin Ouli	


  * While the dyads we have now in the datset are;
    - Buk Ginq	6
    - Buk Ndaw	259
    - Kom Oort	366
    - Nge Oerw	183
    - Pom Guat	5
    - Pom Xian	259
    - Sey Sirk	587
    - Sho Ginq	277
    - Xia Piep	610

```

 * They are a 10  **wrong dyads** that I will have to identify in the dataset and manually correct, those wrong dyads to change and identify are:
    -Buk Ginq - 6 occurences
    -Xin Oort - 4 occurences

  * I will change the occurences of **Buk Ginq** to **Sho Ginq** for **row 613 to 617** and **row 931**. I know these trials are with Sho Ginq because the comments mentioned Sho in them while Male(ID) gave Buk which was a mistake
  * For the **rows from 2710 to 2713** since, Ouli is in the audience it is unlikely that we had trials with the dyad **Xin Ouli**. Also I think they are little chances that the names of both individuals were entered wrong. I will replace these occurences where we had **Xin Oort** by **Kom Oort**
  
  * I thus want **Buk** to be replaced in male ID in rows 613 to 617 and row 913 with **Sho** and, **Xin** to be replaced by **Kom** in rows 2710 to 2713 in Male ID before updating Dyad
  
  
* If Rows 613 to 617 and 931 are coded with Buk for MaleId and Ginq for FemaleId replace Male by Sho

  3. Create the variable called **Trial** where the data will be **sorted by date and dyad** in order to see how many trials have been done with each individual: **One row (per dyad) = one trial** and the    variable called **Day** where the data will be **sorted by date and dyad and day** in order to see how many sessions have been done with each individual: **One day (per dyad) = one session**
  Now, let's proceed with creating the Dyad variable, Trial, and Day:
  
  

4. Make a summary of trial and session so I can see see how many trials and sessions have been done with the individuals

```
## Trial Summary:

5. After relfection I decided to **remove every column** that is with PomGuat since they are not enough trials for this Dyad and since we then changed PomGuat for PomXian. I have 5 occurnces to change. For easier manipulation I will remove every row where there is **Guat**


```
## Change in Rows:  -5
```

  



### 3.7 Female and Male Placement Corn 

* The idea is that for each Dyad, we gave an amount of corn to attract the monkey of a dyad to the right distance of his partner for a trial by putting corn in experiment box that he could get by approaching. We repeated this step as much as needed to have our Dyad at the desired distance to continue the trials from the previous day of experimentation. This means I will only Keep the last number per dyad and day for each day. 
* I decided to create **two variables**, that are called **PlacementMale** and **PlacementFemale** that will only keep the final amount of corn given to each individual within a day of experiment


```
## Placement columns were created successfully.
```

<img src="BEX2223_files/figure-html/PlacementMaleFemale Plot-1.png" width="672" /><img src="BEX2223_files/figure-html/PlacementMaleFemale Plot-2.png" width="672" />




### 3.8 DyadDistance - Creation of proximity
* I would like to create a variable called proximity to have another measure of the proximity of the individuals. 
* First lets look at the maximum and minimum distance found in Dyad Distance

```
## Maximum Distance: 10
```

```
## Minimum Distance: 0
```
* The **minumum Distance** is **0m** while the **maximum Distance** is **10m**
* Then lets make a graph of the frequency for each distances with a line for the median to show the most frquent distance
<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["DyadDistance"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Frequency"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"0","2":"904"},{"1":"1","2":"644"},{"1":"2","2":"471"},{"1":"3","2":"303"},{"1":"4","2":"217"},{"1":"5","2":"133"},{"1":"6","2":"41"},{"1":"7","2":"13"},{"1":"8","2":"9"},{"1":"9","2":"1"},{"1":"10","2":"1"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>


<img src="BEX2223_files/figure-html/DyadDistance Frequency Plot-1.png" width="672" />




* Now lets create a new variable called **Proximity** using the distances found in **DyadDistance** on the following model:
  a. 0 = Contact
  b. 1 - 2 = 1-2
  c. 2 - 3 = 2-3
  d. 4 - 5 = 4-5
  e. 5 - 10 = +5
  



<img src="BEX2223_files/figure-html/Proximity plot-1.png" width="672" />




### 3.9 Dyad Response - Corrections and detailed cleaning

#### 3.9.1

* Reminder: The different behaviors that are coded in **DyadResponse** are: **Distracted**, **Female aggress male**, **Male aggress female**, **Intrusion**, **Loosing interest**, **Not approaching**, **Tolerance** and **Other**
    * I will change the columns associated to each behavior (i.e. Response) of  **DyadResponse**  into dichotomic variables in order to         see the frequency of each behaviour
    * This will allow me to see which behavior occurred more than others, and what differences are between dyads 
    * As multiple behaviours could occur within the same trial, multiple responses (data entries) can be found in a single cell. I will          create a  hierarchy to reduce the amount of behaviors assigned to each trial (if  there is more than one).
      1. correct any potential discrepancies (ex. if tolerance and aggression occured within the same trial aggression>tolerance)
      2. assign as few labels per trial, ideally one using a hierarchy among the occuring behaviours to choose which response to keep
      3. get a better view and understanding of the data and the most common behaviours produced by each dyad producing plots and tables
      4. if necessary create new variables that can complement redistribute the information initally found in the column
      
* I will create some tables to have a better understanding of the state of the column dyadresponse and the different existing combinations at this point

* Also I will create the hierarchy before implementing in the dataset
    
#### 3.9.2 Dyad Response description
  

* I need to know how many different combinations exist within DyadResponse and how many occurrences/cells have more than one response per cell. I need the code to not take in account the order but rather the responses in themselves
* I want one table for the Different combinations and one showing the differernt combinations for only ONE response per cell, in a second table

* There are 18 cases where was **Other** as a Response in the experiment. Here are the modifications I will make for them:
  
  -First lets remember that all of these **DyadResponse** contain **Other** which will make their identification easier
  - Row 39: Since there were No Response as "Other" I will **Delete Row 39** (Buk	Ndaw	No Response)
  - Row 286: In **DyadResponse** instead of **Other** I will put **Tolerance** and in **SpecialBehaviour** I will put **Kom;Ap;Sf;Oort,Oort;Rt;Sc** and in **GotCorn** I will       put **No;Oort** (Kom	Oort	Ooet scream while at the box and Kom get the corm of both)
  - Row 300: In **DyadResponse** I will put **Tolerance** as both individual were at their box at the same time (300	Kom	Oort	Both at boxes; Kom touching the box of Oort)
  - Row 304: In **DyadResponse** I will put **Oort;Ap;After30** in **SpecialBehaviour** (Kom	Oort	Kom touching         Oort’s box. Oort came after 30 sec to her own box.)
  - Row 700: Since ther were No Response as "Other" I will **Delete Row 700** (	Nge	Oerw	No Response)
  - Row 815: Since ther were No Response as "Other" I will **Delete Row 815** (Pom	Xian	No Response)
  - Row 826: Since ther were No Response as "Other" I will **Delete Row 826** (Pom	Xian	No Response)
  - Row 1484: In **Row 1484** I will replace the **DyadResponse** occurence **Other by **Tolerance** and put **Sirk;ApproachWithPartner** (Sey	Sirk	wait for her. moved back and waited for sirk     to approach and came back)
  - Row 1659: Since there were No Response as "Other" I will **Delete Row 1659** (1659	Sho	Ginq	No Response)
  - Row 1741: In **Row 1174** Sho stole corn to Ginq. I will put **Sho;Sf;Ginq** in             **SpecialBehaviour** and **No;Ginq** in **GotCorn** (Sho	Ginq	Sho took one of her corn)
  - Row 2101: The information in **Row 2101** stating **aggression from Pix** is not clear to whom. I will **delete Row 2101** (Xia	Piep	aggression)
  - Row 2102: In **Row 2102** Xia stole corn to Piep. I will put **Tolerance** in **DyadResponse**, **Xia;Sf;Piep** in **SpecialBehvaiour** and **No;Piep** in **GotCorn** (Xia	     Piep	Xia ate corn from both boxes)
  - Row 2103: In **Row 2103** Xia stole corn to Piep. I will put **Tolerance** in **DyadResponse**, **Xia;Sf;Piep** in **SpecialBehvaiour** and **No;Piep** in **GotCorn** (Xia	     Piep	Xia stolen some pieces from piep box)
  - Row 2104: In **Row 2104** Xia stole corn to Piep. I will put **Tolerance** in **DyadResponse**, **Xia;Sf;Piep** in **SpecialBehvaiour** and **No;Piep** in **GotCorn** (Xia	     Piep  Xia immediately go for piep box and eat her corn then eat his.)
  - Row 2105: In **Row 2105** Xia stole corn to Piep. I will put **Tolerance** in **DyadResponse**, **Xia;Sf;Piep** iN **SpecialBehvaiour** and **No;Piep** in **GotCorn** (Xia	     Piep	piep got 2 pieces out of 3. Xia took one corn)
  - Row 2170: In **Row 2170** I will replace **DyadResponse** by **Female aggress male** (Piep	Xia	fem ag male)
  - Row 2184: As both individual did not approach and **Not approaching** is already in DyadResponse, I will just remove **Other** from **DyadResponse**Xia	Piep	Neither ID         approach (Xia	Piep	Neither ID approach)
  - Row 2729:	As there was a mistake in **Row 2729** I will delete this line: **Delete Row 2729** (Xin	Ouli	opened for oerw)
  - Finally I will delete all the occurences of **Other** in DyadResponse

* First I will remove the lines with the combinations **Other & No Response**


```
## Number of combinations with 'Other' in DyadResponse and 'No Response' in OtherResponse:  5
```

```
## Row numbers:  39, 700, 815, 826, 1659
```

```
## Number of rows that have been changed:  5
```

```
## Number of occurrences of 'Other' in DyadResponse left:  13
```

* Then I will treat the remaining 13 lines according to the rules I explained


```
## Number of rows changed:  13
```

```
## No rows found with 'Other' in DyadResponse.
```

```
## Number of occurrences of 'Other' removed from DyadResponse:  18
```

```
## Number of occurrences replaced with 'No Response' in OtherResponse:  34
```
* We now have 0 remaing rows with **Others** in **DyadResponse** and have removed the cases where we had different outputs than **Other Resposne** in the **Other** column


##### 3.9.3.c Decision making for Dyad Response Hierarchy

*  I will create a **Hierarchy for DyadResponse** in order to treat cases where multiple behaviours were produced within a trial in order to reduce the amount of responses and clear any discrepancies that could be found

* **Aggression & Tolerance**: I will keep **Agression** as we defined tolerance as the absence of any sign of aggression between individuals of a Dyad. Each Time we wrote tolerance it means that the monkeys touched the boxes at the same time. I will create a variable called **SimulatenousTouch** to record every time the box did the action at the same time. Then I will in every case of aggression and tolerance within a trial keep Aggression: **Aggression > Tolerance**. (Note that aggression is not yet a variable in itself but instead we have Male aggress female & Female aggress male as occurences of aggression)


```
## Number of cases with Tolerance & Male aggress female:  31
```

```
## Number of cases with Tolerance & Female aggress male:  24
```

```
## Number of rows changed:  55
```

```
## Number of lines remaining with both Aggression and Tolerance:  0
```


* **Tolerance & Loosing interest**: I will keep **Tolerance** as it means that the dyad did touch the boxes: **Tolerance > Loosing interest**



```
## Number of cases with Tolerance & Losing interest:  23
```

```
## Number of rows changed:  23
```

```
## Number of lines remaining with both Tolerance and Losing interest:  0
```

* **Tolerance & Intrusion**: I will keep **Tolerance**. Before replacing these occurrences I will created a variable called **Intrusion** the value will be Yes if there was Intrusion in DyadResponse (alone or with another response) and No if there wasn't any Intrusion: **Tolerance > Intrusion**



```
## Number of cases with Tolerance & Intrusion:  53
```

```
## Number of rows changed:  53
```

```
## Number of lines remaining with both Tolerance and Intrusion:  0
```

* **Not approaching & Loosing interest**: I will keep both as **Not approaching = looking box but not coming to it ** while **Loosing interest = not paying attention to the box and not coming to it**



```
## Number of cases with Not approaching & Losing interest:  50
```







* **Intrusion & Not approaching**: I will keep Intrusion: **Intrusion > Not approaching**


```
## Number of cases with Intrusion & Not approaching:  33
```

```
## Number of changes made to remove 'Not Approaching' with 'Intrusion':  33
```

```
## Number of remaining cases with both Intrusion and Not approaching:  0
```

* **Not approaching & Distracted**: I will keep **Not approaching**: **Not approaching > Distracted**


```
## Number of cases with Not approaching & Distracted:  7
```

```
## Number of changes made to remove 'Distracted' with 'Not approaching':  7
```

```
## Number of remaining cases with both Not approaching and Distracted:  0
```

* **Male Aggress Female / Female Aggress Female** and **Not Approaching**: I will keep both Aggression > Not approaching


```
## Number of cases with Male Aggress Female & Not Approaching:  2
```

```
## Number of cases with Female Aggress Male & Not Approaching:  3
```

```
## Total number of cases with Aggression & Not Approaching:  5
```

```
## Number of changes made to remove 'Not Approaching' with 'Male aggress female':  2
```

```
## Number of changes made to remove 'Not Approaching' with 'Female aggress male':  3
```

```
## Number of remaining cases with Male Aggress Female & Not Approaching:  0
```

```
## Number of remaining cases with Female Aggress Male & Not Approaching:  0
```

* **Male aggress Female** and **Female aggress male**: create a variable called **Aggression** and put **Yes** for every occurrences of Female and Male aggression and **No** when there wasn't


```
## Number of cases with Male aggress female:  108
```

```
## Number of cases with Female aggress male:  46
```

```
## Total number of aggression cases:  151
```

* **Tolerance & Not approaching**: I will keep **Tolerance** as it means that one of the individuals took more than 30 seconds to come at the box and then at the end came. In these cases 
I will create a variable called **Hesistant** to count the frequency of times where the monkey took more time to approach than in the usual trials. Once the variable is created based on all the occurence of tolerance and not approaching, I will replace all the occurences of not approaching and tolerance with tolerance: **Tolerance > No approaching**


```
## Number of cases with Tolerance & Not Approaching:  6
```

```
## Number of rows changed:  6
```

```
## Number of lines remaining with both Tolerance and Not Approaching:  0
```




# 4.Visualizing the data

# 4.1 Reordering the variables in Bex

*Now that all the variables have been treated and cleaned I want to modify thew variables in Bex to keep only the ones I need and to put them in the right order

#### Code to keep and place again
# Code to settle 

I also chose to directly create new dichotomic variables for "Not approaching", "Intrusion", "Losing interest", "Distracted", for this I would like the function to
  1.Check if there is a **value different than "No individual"**
  2.**If the value ≠"No individual"** then I want it to **take the response found in "DyadResposne"**

### Update of Dataframe BexClean with revelant variables



### Exploratory Graph (To organise)

####Dyad, Distance & Date

* Trials of grpahs, I will have to check all of them

* My goal here is too see if each dyad have an general evolution of their dyad distance trough time and how many varaition do they have

    * I will create a variable called **Session** where **1 session = 1 day**
    * The data has values from the **14th of September 2022** until the **13th of September 2023**
    * I will also create a variable called **Trial** to know how many trials have been done with each dyad where **1 row = 1 trial** 
    
    * I may consider, in parallel of my hypothesis, to separate the data in *4 seasons* to make a preliminary check of a potential effect of seasonality. Nevertheless the fact that we did not use anywithout      tools to mesure the weather and the idea to make a categorization in 4 seasons without considering the actua quite arbitrary. I may do it but with no intention to include this in my scientific report.
    l temperature, food quantitiy and other elements related to seasonailty make this categorizationn a categorization where 12 months of          data will be separated in 4 categories
   


* But before I may want to make a few changes already by merging **Male corn** and **Male placement corn** into " Male corn" and maybe replacing all of the NA's in "Other response" by response

#Lines to check unique values in MaleFemaleID to see if they are any problems with it
# Unique values in MaleID
unique_male_ids <- unique(BexClean$MaleID)

# Unique values in FemaleID
unique_female_ids <- unique(Bex$FemaleID)









# Sections below are here for the organization of my paper and will be worked on once the data cleaning and exploration is done

## 3. Describing the data



## 5.Research question & Hypothesis

### Research question

-   What factors influence the rate at which individuals (vervets) learn
    to tolerate each other in a controlled box experiment?

-   Ex: The rate at which individuals (vervets) learn to tolerate each
    other in a box experiment is influenced by social factors (audience,
    social network, behavior of the partner) and idioyncratic factors
    (age, rank)

### Hypothesis

-   1.  Hypothesis about the Presence of High-Ranking Individuals:

The presence of a higher number of high-ranking individuals in the
audience will negatively correlate with the level of tolerance achieved
among vervets in the box experiment. This is expected to result in
higher frequencies of aggressive behaviors, intrusions, and loss of
interest, particularly from lower-ranking individuals.

-   2.  Hypothesis about Partner Agonistic Behaviors:

Vervets tolerance levels in the box experiment will be influenced by
their partner’s display of agonistic behaviors. Specifically, partners
who exhibit more frequent agonistic behaviors towards their partner will
lead to decrease in their motivation to participate in future trials.

-   3.  Hypothesis about the Establishment of an Optimal Distance:

During the box experiment, vervet dyads will establish an “optimal”
distance for interaction, characterized by a higher frequency of
tolerance compared to other distances. This optimal distance is expected
to signify that the individuals tolerate each other more effectively at
this specific proximity .

-   4.  Hypothesis about Age and Rank:

The age and rank of individual vervets within the group will influence
the success of the trials in the box experiment. Specifically, older and
higher-ranking individuals are expected to exhibit lower rates of
success compared to dyads consisting of younger and lower-ranked
individuals. This decrease in success is anticipated to be associated
with a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors displayed by older and
higher-ranking individuals towards their partners. (I’m not sure this
hypothesis makes sens, I have the feeling age and rank must have an
influence but I don’t know how to put it, I will think about it)

-   5.  Hyptohesis about seasonality

Seasonality is expected to impact the motivation of vervet dyads to
participate in the box experiment. We hypothesize that dyads will have
lower motivation, as indicated by a reduced number of trials, during the
summer months compared to the winter months. This difference in
motivation is likely influenced by temperature and food availability. To
test this hypothesis, we will categorize the data into four seasonal
periods, each spanning four months, and analyze whether there is a
significant effect of seasonality on the motivation to engage in the
trials.

## 6.Statistical tests and analisis of the data

### Statistical tests

-   **Hypothesis 1**: Influence of High-Ranking Individuals

Variables Needed:

**DyadResponse** (specifically, “aggression” responses)
**Amountaudience** (to measure the number of individuals in the
audience) **Audience…15** (to identify the names of individuals in the
audience for calculating dominance ranks) **Elo rating** of the
individuals based on the ab libitum data collected in IVP (which I have
to calculate asap)

Statistical Analysis:**Logistic Regression**, as it could analyze the
influence of high-ranking individuals on the occurrence of aggression in
dyad responses. This will help determine whether the presence of
high-ranking individuals affects the likelihood of aggression.

-   **Hypothesis 2**: Impact of Partner’s Agonistic Behaviors

Variables Needed:

-   **DyadResponse** (specifically, “aggression” responses)
-   **MaleagressF** (male’s aggression towards female)
-   **FemaleaggressM** (female’s aggression towards male)

Statistical Analysis: **Logistic Regression** as it could be used to
assess how the occurrence of aggression in dyad responses is influenced
by the partner’s gender-specific agonistic behaviors.

-   **Hypothesis 3**: Identification of an Optimal Interaction Distance

Variables Needed:

-   **DyadDistance** (distance between boxes)
-   **Tolerance** (as a binary outcome)

Statistical Analysis: **generalized Linear Model (GLM)** to investigate
whether there is an optimal distance that leads to a higher likelihood
of tolerance (Tolerance = 1).

-   **Hypothesis 4**: Role of Age and Rank

Variables Needed:

-   **Tolerance** (as a binary outcome)
-   **Male and Female** (to identify individuals’ ages and ranks)
-   **Dyad** (to link individuals to dyads)
-   **Birthdate** to calculate the age of each individual

Statistical Analysis: **Logistic Regression** Logistic regression can be
employed to determine whether the age and rank of individual vervets
within dyads have an impact on the likelihood of tolerance (Tolerance =
1).

-   **Hypothesis 5**: Influence of Seasonality

Variables Needed:

-   **Date** (to categorize data into seasons)
-   **Trial** (to count the number of trials in each season) and the
    data for at least 365 days so i can separate the data in 4 (1 year =
    4 seasons = 12\*4 month) to see if they may be an effect of
    seasonality on the motivation (amount of trials) of the dyads

Statistical Analysis:

ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis Test: Depending on the distribution of your
trial data, you can use either ANOVA (if the data are normally
distributed) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (for non-normally distributed
data) to assess the impact of seasonality on the number of trials. If
significant differences are found, you can follow up with post-hoc tests
to identify which seasons differ from each other. Please note that the
effectiveness of these analyses may depend on the distribution of your
data and specific research objectives. You may also consider conducting
exploratory data analysis (e.g., visualization) to gain a better
understanding of your dataset before performing these analyses.
Additionally, if you have specific questions about data preprocessing or
variable transformations, feel free to ask for further guidance. –> I
took this from ChatGPT, I have to look more into it

**REMARKS**: So here are a few updates I made in the document. I also
planned to send my cleaned data to Radu (the statistician of UNINE) as
he was keen to help me find the right test. Of course I will also look
again in Bshary’s and Charlotte’s work with the boxes and improve these
suggestions that are quite simple for now

Also I still have to clean the last grpahs about male/female aggression
as I didn’t finish that yet. I juste wanted to share my hypothesis and
ideas for statistics so I can soon go into the “serious” work

Anyway, thank you in advance for your help \<3

# Key cognitive skilly that may be involved in the box experiment
* Problem solving
* Memory
* Conflict resolution
* Cooperation


# Key idea to develop & insghts
* Inter sexual food competition/or tolerance: which type of adaptation
* Tolerance
* Adaptation to a new context (box experiment setting and repeated encounters with a specific individual)
* Evolution of tolerance in competitive context
* Social cognition > meaning influence of the group or audience on the choice of an individual of a Dyad
* Primate social structure and dynamics

* Foundation of tolerance, solving of competition related to food, mechanisms underlying male-female vervet relationships, dyadic interactions
* Insights on the evolution of complex decision making in a social context and adaptive mechanisms related to food competition x


In summary, studying dyadic interactions, particularly between males and females in vervet monkeys, not only enhances our understanding of evolutionary origins and adaptive advantages of complex cognition but also provides valuable insights into human social behavior, cooperation, and cognitive foundations shared across species. These studies bridge the gap between animal behavior research and cognitive science, offering interdisciplinary perspectives on the complexities of social interactions and their implications for both animal and human societies.



# Glossary
* **Tolerance**: Tolerance: An individual has an encounter with a conspecific and
  can freely leave but remains in the encounter without acting aggressively
  toward the conspecific. (Pisor & Surbeck, 2019)
* **Agression**
* **Session** 
* **Trial**
* **Group**: In the Primate order, groups are individuals “which remain [physically] together in or separate from a larger unit” and interact with each other more than with other individuals.6 This            definition does not cover all uses of the word “group” in the social sciences (e.g., human identity groups who identify with a common name or symbol may or may not interact with one another more frequently   than with other individuals). Because of this ambiguity, we use the word “community” when referring to humans to better capture the notion of spatial proximity, per Ref. 54. Members of the same group are    referred to as “same-group” and those from another group “extra-group.” (Pisor & Surbeck, 2019)
